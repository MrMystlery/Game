    <h1>Embedding an External Website</h1>
    <iframe src="https://fnf.kdata1.com/american-founding-fathers/1/" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
In this example, the src attribute of the <iframe> element specifies the URL of the external website to be embedded, which is https://www.example.com. The width and height attributes specify the size of the <iframe> in pixels.

Note that the external website being embedded may have security restrictions that prevent it from being embedded within an <iframe>. In that case, you may not be able to display the external website.
